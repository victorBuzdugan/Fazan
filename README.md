# Fazan
Romanian game "Fazan"

## Description
Each player enters a word starting with the last two letters of the previous entered word.
The objective is to eliminate the next player with a word (*end game word*) ending in two letters that can't be used for another word.

The game uses romanian words without diacritics but can also be used with another dictionary.

## Rules
The first time, or after a player has been eliminated, the first player still in the game has to enter a word starting with a random letter. At this stage the playing player can't eliminate the next player with an *end game word*.
Players can't reuse words that have been played in previous rounds.


## Extra
The "computer" player can have different skill level from easy (1) to hard (10). This determines the probability of choosing an *end game word* or at level 7 and beyond the probability of choosing a word that doesn't offers the oportunity to the next player to enter an *end game word*.

The dictionary included has a lot of words that aren't really suited to be used in game (diminutives, names and so on). As the task of filtering all the dictionary words would take a lot of time, instead the players have the posibility to add words or remove unsuitable words that the computer player proposes.
